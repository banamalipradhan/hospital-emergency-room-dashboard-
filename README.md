# Hospital Emergency Room Performance & Patient Flow Dashboard (Excel) 

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **Microsoft Excel can be used to build interactive, insight-driven dashboards** when applied with the right analytical approach.

The dashboard focuses on **Emergency Department (ED) performance and patient flow**, enabling healthcare stakeholders to monitor wait times, patient volume, service efficiency, and demographic patterns in a single, interactive view.

---

## Business Objective
Emergency departments handle high patient volumes under time-sensitive conditions.  
The objective of this dashboard is to:

- Identify **patient flow bottlenecks**
- Monitor **wait time performance**
- Track **service-level efficiency**
- Support **data-driven operational decisions**

---

## Key Insights Delivered
- Analyzed **10,000+ emergency department patient visits**
- Identified an **average patient wait time of ~35 minutes**, with peak-period delays
- Measured the **percentage of patients seen within the target service time**
- Compared **admitted vs non-admitted patient flow**
- Evaluated **patient satisfaction scores** alongside wait times
- Segmented patients by **age group and gender** for demographic insights

---

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts  
- Calculated KPIs  
- Slicers for interactive filtering 

---

## KPIs Included
- Total Patients  
- Average Wait Time  
- % Patients Seen Within Target Time  
- Patient Satisfaction Score  
- Admission Status

## Dashboard Development Process
1. Cleaned and prepared the raw emergency department dataset  
2. Defined and calculated key performance indicators (KPIs)  
3. Built structured Pivot Tables for operational and demographic analysis  
4. Designed Pivot Charts for trends, comparisons, and distributions  
5. Added slicers to enable dynamic filtering by:
   - Date  
   - Department  
   - Gender  
   - Age Group
